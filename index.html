                <p>As a chef, I wake up thinking about food. How will I utilize it that day? Sourcing a new flour to
                    make a fresh, stuffed pasta at my Italian restaurant, Amalfi? Zesting a citrus fruit I picked up at
                    the farmer’s market? Working on a new chile-flecked mayo to slather on a fried chicken sandwich at
                    my burger</p>

                    <p class="info-font">the kugel that my mom made growing up was based on emeril’s recipe. it was such
                        a great combination of richness and milkiness and it had the perfect touch of cinnamon and
                        sugar, as well as a toasty nutty topping. it was, and continues to be, the only place that i eat
                        cottage cheese. for some reason it’d been a really really long time since we had it at holidays
                        and it wasn’t until the fargo hotdish festival that i was reminded of it because bernbaum’s
                        kugel was so similar.
